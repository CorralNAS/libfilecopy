libfilecopy

Copying files is a deceptively complicated task -- even when copying only a
single file-system object, copying extended attributes and ACLs mean it's not
simply a matter of open-open-read-write-close-close.  Especially with ACLs,
since inherited entries can complicate things immensely.

filecopy() here is inspired by Darwin's copyfile() routine.  Since it's not
compatible with it, I changed the name, but I may try to write a stub for the
simple cases later on.  Right now, the main lack is the serialization (packing
and unpacking).  (Note:  at no point with filecopy's serialization be compatible
with copyfile's.  The latter uses the AppleDouble format, which is arcane and
cannot be generated while streaming.  I'll go with a simple custom format, or
possibly simply use tar's format and attach semantics.)

treecopy() does recursive copies.  This is where the real complication in
copying comes out, because of inherited ACLs.

This is very new code, and has bugs and limitations.  They'll be worked on.
